## Rationale

<!-- split -->

Concurrent with broader developments in Open Science and increased transparency 
in research, Open Peer Review is a complex, and rapidly evolving topic. Alongside 
this, more diverse criteria of research evaluation beyond traditional methods are 
emerging, and with these come a range of practical, ethical, and social factors 
to consider. This module will provide insight into current developments in Open 
Peer Review and research evaluation.

## Learning outcomes

* The researcher will be able to describe the history of peer review in the 
  context of scholarly publishing, the criticisms levied against ‘traditional’ 
  peer review, and the ongoing developments with Open Peer Review.
* The researcher will be able to use a range of post-publication review, 
  commenting, and annotation services.
* The researcher will be able to describe the issues associated with the use of 
  ‘traditional’ metrics in research evaluation, and the role that peer evaluation 
  and ‘next-generation’ metrics (or ‘altmetrics’) play in this.
* The researcher will be able to use a range of services to build and demonstrate 
  their personal research impact profile, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
* The researcher will become familiar with the relevant criteria for research 
  evaluation to them, and be able to have a critical discussion about them with 
  their colleagues and those who drafted them.
